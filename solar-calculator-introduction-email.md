Subject: API Access Request - Solar Calculator Canada Platform

Dear [Recipient Name/Organization],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing on behalf of Solar Calculator Canada (solarcalculatorcanada.org) to request API access for collecting client usage data to enhance our solar estimation platform for Canadian homeowners.

About Solar Calculator Canada

Solar Calculator Canada is a free, user-friendly web application that provides accurate solar energy calculations and estimates for homeowners across all provinces and territories in Canada. Our platform empowers users to understand their solar potential, evaluate financial returns, and make data-driven decisions about renewable energy investments.

Our platform offers comprehensive solar calculations including:

- Rooftop solar system sizing and production estimates
- Financial analysis with payback periods and ROI projections
- Net metering program evaluations
- Peak shaving calculations for time-of-use rate plans
- Battery storage integration analysis
- System cost and rebate calculations
- Environmental impact assessments

Purpose of API Access Request

To provide the most accurate and personalized solar estimates, our platform requires access to historical electricity usage data for our clients. Currently, users must manually input their usage information, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. API access to retrieve usage data directly would significantly improve the user experience and calculation accuracy.

Specifically, we are requesting API access to:

1. Retrieve historical electricity consumption data for customers who authorize access
2. Access hourly, daily, or monthly usage patterns to enable precise solar system sizing
3. Obtain rate plan information to calculate accurate savings projections
4. Access billing data to provide comprehensive financial analysis

Benefits of API Integration

API integration would provide several benefits:

**For Your Customers:**
- Streamlined experience with automatic data retrieval
- More accurate solar estimates based on actual usage patterns
- Reduced manual data entry and potential errors
- Faster access to personalized solar calculations

**For Your Organization:**
- Support for customers exploring renewable energy options
- Contribution to Canada's clean energy transition goals
- Enhanced customer engagement with solar energy solutions
- Potential for increased customer satisfaction

**For Solar Calculator Canada:**
- Improved calculation accuracy through real usage data
- Enhanced user experience and platform adoption
- Better support for Canadian homeowners considering solar

Data Security and Privacy

We take data security and customer privacy seriously. Our API integration would:

- Only access data with explicit customer authorization
- Comply with all applicable privacy regulations including PIPEDA
- Implement secure authentication and encryption protocols
- Use data solely for solar calculation purposes
- Not share customer data with third parties
- Allow customers to revoke access at any time

We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of data protection and would be happy to discuss our security protocols and compliance measures in detail.

Request Details

We are requesting:

1. API documentation and access credentials
2. Information about authentication methods and requirements
3. Details on data format, endpoints, and rate limits
4. Any required agreements or terms of service
5. Timeline and process for API access approval

We understand that API access requests typically require review and approval processes. We are prepared to provide any additional information, documentation, or security assessments that may be required.

Expected Timeline

Based on similar API integration projects, we anticipate the integration process may take 4-6 weeks from approval to full implementation. We are flexible and can work within your organization's timeline and requirements.
